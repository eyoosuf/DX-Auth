Introduction
===

DX Auth is an authentication library for Code Igniter. It’s goal to enable you to easily include secure and easy to use authentication library to your project, while giving you the flexibility to choose from simple authentication system to full fledged authentication system.

DX Auth is also build with internationalization in mind, so every string is available in language file. (Except the examples because that is your code, not the library).

It’s based on CL Auth 0.2.5 beta developed by Jason Ashdown.
